        Hardware flow control is DISABLED here because UART is used only for debugging,
        and if we leave it enabled but nothing is connected to the UART port, then the
        internal buffer fills up and eventually locks the module. In a production setting
        where you actually care about the data going over the UART interface, you will
        definitely want flow control to remain ENABLED (which is the default setting).
