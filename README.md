# Jeff Rowberg's Bluegiga Material

This is a collection of documents and other resources specifically related to
my role as a Bluegiga FAE, particularly for providing easy, consolidated access
for presentation material and accompanying source code.

For more information about Bluegiga and the various products we provide, please
visit http://www.bluegiga.com for all available product material. I also highly
recommend going to http://support.bluegiga.com to create a free account which
will give you access to our Tech Forum, Knowledge Base and support system which
can help tremendously in getting started with our products.
